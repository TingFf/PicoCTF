## Comment  
1. Been using quite a lot of exiftool for the challenges.  

## Challenge Overview  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Description:**   
The judge for these pictures is a real fan of antiques. Can you age this photo to the specifications?
Set the timestamps on this picture to ```1970:01:01 00:00:00.001+00:00``` with as much precision as possible for each timestamp. 
In this example, ```+00:00``` is a timezone adjustment. Any timezone is acceptable as long as the time is equivalent. 
As an example, this timestamp is acceptable as well: ```1969:12:31 19:00:00.001-05:00```. 
For timestamps without a timezone adjustment, put them in GMT time ```(+00:00)```.   
The checker program provides the timestamp needed for each.  
Use this picture.
