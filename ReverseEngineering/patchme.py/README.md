## Comment  
1. Not sure whether I should use disassembly decompile tools to help me understand and learn better.  

## Challenge Overview  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Description:** Understand python code.  
## Tools Used  
NIL  

## Writeup

1. Basically, the code compare user input with "ak98-=90adfjhgj321sleuth9000".  
2. If its matches, the code will decode the encoded flag from the other file with a key(utilitarian) and print the decrypted flag.  

    
## Stuff Learned  
1. Difference between Decode and Decryption.  
    **Decode:**  
        -Applied on data to make it fit a certain format or reduce its size.  
        -Does not involve security or keys.  
    **Decryption:**  
        -Converts encrypted (ciphertext) data back into its original form (plaintext).  
        -Requires knowledge of the encryption algorithm and the correct key.  
        -Protect data by making it unreadable to unauthorized users.
