## Comment
1. For this challenge, I had to look at the writeup to get the flag.  
2. The link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKYwzmRcLtw&t=92s  

## Challenge Overview
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Description:** Reverse engineer the file without using debugger. 
## Tools Used
**Ghidra, Debugview, PEiD, UPX**

1. Using UPX to decompressed the file.

2. As the challenge provides a pdb file, we can load it into the exe file.(File tab -> Load PDB file)   
3. Make sure to not analyse the file first.  

*A PDB file (Program Database file) is a debugging information file generated by Microsoft compilers (e.g., MSVC). It contains detailed information about a compiled program, including symbols, function names, variable names, and memory addresses. PDB files are invaluable for debugging and reverse engineering because they provide insights into the internal structure of an executable.*  
*- Maps cryptic memory addresses to readable names like function names (main) and variable names.*  
*- Provides meaningful names instead of generic ones (sub_401000 becomes processData).*  
*- Links executable code to original source lines for easier understanding of logic.*  
*- Reveals class, struct, and enum definitions, helping identify data layouts.*  
*- Shows function names and arguments in call stacks instead of raw addresses.*  
*- Enhances analysis tools (e.g., IDA Pro, Ghidra, x64dbg) by loading symbols for better readability.*

4. Locate a wWinMain function  
5. Go into "ChallengeThreadFunction"

6. As it seems this function is the one that constantly checks for a debugger every five sec  
7. Its preventing the code logic from getting the flag

8. By clearing the jmp instructions(right click->clear Code Bytes) and patching with NOP instructions (right click-> Patch Instruction)  
9. Now looking back at the code logic. After five sec, the flag will be display.

10. Export the patched exe file, run as admin and the flag will be display out.  

**Stuff Learned**  
1. Make sure to check whether file is packed.  
2. If PDB file provided, USE IT.  
3. Check the code logic whether if its preventing from reaching a specific functions or other codes.
