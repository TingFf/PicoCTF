## Comment  
1. My first picoCTF 2025 competition.
2. Overall I am satisfied with my progress.


## Challenge Overview  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Description:** Exploiting how the code split the line 
## Tools Used  
NIL  

## Writeup  
```
import re
import time


# Read in flag from file
flag = open('flag.txt', 'r').read()

The ether’s ours to conquer, '''\

[REFRAIN]
We’re flag hunters in the ether, lighting up the grid,
No puzzle too dark, no challenge too hid.
With every exploit we trigger, every byte we decrypt,
We’re chasing that victory, and we’ll never quit.
CROWD (Singalong here!);
RETURN

[VERSE1]
Command line wizards, we’re starting it right,
Spawning shells in the terminal, hacking all night.
Scripts and searches, grep through the void,
Every keystroke, we're a cypher's envoy.
Brute force the lock or craft that regex,
Flag on the horizon, what challenge is next?

REFRAIN;

Echoes in memory, packets in trace,
Digging through the remnants to uncover with haste.
Hex and headers, carving out clues,
Resurrect the hidden, it's forensics we choose.
Disk dumps and packet dumps, follow the trail,
Buried deep in the noise, but we will prevail.

REFRAIN;

Binary sorcerers, let’s tear it apart,
Disassemble the code to reveal the dark heart.
From opcode to logic, tracing each line,
Emulate and break it, this key will be mine.
Debugging the maze, and I see through the deceit,
Patch it up right, and watch the lock release.

REFRAIN;

Ciphertext tumbling, breaking the spin,
Feistel or AES, we’re destined to win.
Frequency, padding, primes on the run,
Vigenère, RSA, cracking them for fun.
Shift the letters, matrices fall,
Decrypt that flag and hear the ether call.

REFRAIN;

SQL injection, XSS flow,
Map the backend out, let the database show.
Inspecting each cookie, fiddler in the fight,
Capturing requests, push the payload just right.
HTML's secrets, backdoors unlocked,
In the world wide labyrinth, we’re never lost.

REFRAIN;

Stack's overflowing, breaking the chain,
ROP gadget wizardry, ride it to fame.
Heap spray in silence, memory's plight,
Race the condition, crash it just right.
Shellcode ready, smashing the frame,
Control the instruction, flags call my name.

REFRAIN;

END;

reader(song_flag_hunters, '[VERSE1]')
```
1. The way to get the flag is to point the song to read the secret_intro at the start of the song.
2. The only input is to "sing along"

3. Looking at the code, the return is the one that point which set of lyrics the song will be so I tried enter "Return 1"
4. But RETURN [0-9] != CROWD RETURN 1.
5. So we have to make the RETURN 1 to the next line from the code POV.
6. Hence the only way is to exploit how the code split the lyrics.
7. Since it split base on ;.
8. Now it will split like this:
```
We’re flag hunters in the ether, lighting up the grid,
No puzzle too dark, no challenge too hid.
With every exploit we trigger, every byte we decrypt,
We’re chasing that victory, and we’ll never quit.
CROWD ;RETURN 0;
RETURN
```
```
1. We’re flag hunters in the ether, lighting up the grid,
2. No puzzle too dark, no challenge too hid.
3. With every exploit we trigger, every byte we decrypt,
4. We’re chasing that victory, and we’ll never quit.
5. CROWD
6. RETURN 0
7. RETURN X

## Stuff Learned  
1. Must divide, conquer and eliminate to solve the problem.
